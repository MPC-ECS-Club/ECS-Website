                In collaboration with JAL Berry Farms, <i>T.E.R.A.</i>
                is a computer-vision based agricultural drone. Using <b>depth-analysis</b> and <b>machine learning</b>, 
                <i>T.E.R.A.</i> will be able to detect <b>harvestable berries</b>, <b>topological data</b>, and <b>soil moisture</b> when completed. 
                <i>T.E.R.A.</i> is a promising technological endeavor to offer a cost-effective solution to farming.

                <i>Happy Caterpillar</i> was our exhibit for the STEAM competition and STEM Family Day. The game is a
                recreation of the game <i>Snake</i> running on an Arduino microcontroller and displayed on a strip
                of NeoPixel LEDs. The cabinet was designed and painted in-house. To create the defined blocky look,
                a
                custom grid was 3D-printed and laid on top of the LED strips. For our efforts, we were voted as the
                favorite exhibit of the show and helped invigorate many people's enthusiasm for STEM.<br><br>
